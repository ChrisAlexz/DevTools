# DEV-4: Remove unnecessary React files and code to reduce codebase size and complexity.

## Bug Report
Reduced codebase size, improved maintainability, potentially improved performance due to smaller bundle size.

## Steps to Reproduce
['1. Examine the React codebase.', '2. Identify React components, utility functions, and other files that are no longer used or are redundant.', '3. Verify that identified files and code are not referenced by any other part of the application.', '4. Remove the unnecessary files and code.']

## Suggested Fix
N/A - This task involves removing code rather than adding/modifying it. A series of deletions will be performed across multiple files.
